      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The Mzamomtsha Primary School was established in 1999, built in collaboration with SAOTA, in a small township in Cape Town called Driftsand.<br>The school was initially created for Primary School students from grades 1 to 7, but plans are underway for the enrollment of students up until grade 12.<br>Currently, the School is run by over 50 teachers and has over 700 students.</p><br>
      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>The School's teaching philosophy is supported by a strong commitment to exposing students to both  the academic and practical aspects of learning, and our teaching is  complemented by teaching students in their home languages.
        <br>Classes are highly interactive,as they are facilitated in smaller groups, and students are given a unique opportunity to understand in depth and put in practice knowledge they've been exposed to in class.</p>
        <br>
      <h2>Vision and Mission</h2>
        <p>At Mzamomtsha, we strive to empower students to acquire, demonstrate, articulate and value the knowledge and skills that will support them, their futures and their contribution to society. <br>
        We strive to instill our schools core values into our students of respect, tolerence and inclusion so that they can participate and contribute to the global world and practice these values.<br>
        Our mission is to develop students with active and creative mindsets, a sense of understanding and compassion for others, and the courage to act on their beliefs. We stress the total development of each child spiritually, morally, intelectually, socially, emotionally and physically.</p>
